# Requesting Help

While working on the Meerkat cluster you may have technical enquiries. This could be, but not limited to, issues with running your jobs on the cluster, transferring data to and from the cluster, creating project groups, etc.

If you feel that you have an issue that you would like the technical staff to have a look at, feel free to send a mail to eresearch-support@uwc.ac.za with a detailed description of the issue.

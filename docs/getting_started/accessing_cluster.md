# Accessing the Meerkat Cluster

The Meerkat cluster is accessed via `ssh` at `meerkat.uwc.ac.za`.

Users can ssh to the Meerkat cluster from the terminal using

```bash
$ ssh <username>@meerkat.uwc.ac.za
```

This will place the user on the cluster head node. **Please do not run any software on the head node**. The head node is for job submission and job management only.

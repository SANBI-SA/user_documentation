# Apply for Access

The UWC Meerkat Cluster supports data intensive research for UWC faculty, research staff, postdocs and postgraduate students.

Please complete the following [webform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-fgPbGS_-TnqfKVXwqHbFlCAST5tlvtuunNQ8kO7TX3K6yg/viewform) to apply for access to the UWC Meerkat Cluster.

In order to access the UWC Meerkat Cluster users require their UWC Network Credentials (Microsoft Active Directory credentials, formerly known as Novell credentials). These are the same credentials used to access e.g. https://ikamva.uwc.ac.za/, but they are NOT the same as your UWC e-mail access credentials. If you do not know your network credentials please contact UWC service desk at servicedesk@uwc.ac.za.
